# Remind me, Doc

Remind me, Doc is a bot in Messenger (Facebook) that helps people to stay healthy. 
This bot has access to your medical card in DrChrono and can send you information about the medication that your doctor has prescribed for you, including timing, dosage information and pharmacy note such as when you should take this pill after/before or with meals. You can set up a time and the bot will remind you to take medicine in this time by sending you a message on Facebook. Also, Remind me, Doc bot will help you to measure your vitals daily (temperature, blood pressure, pulse, pain level) and will add this data to your medical card in DrChrono. In case you have dangerous health indicators the bot will propose you to visit your doctor and will help you immediately to schedule an appointment via Messenger. Also, if your doctor recommends you to do some compulsory checkups during this year the bot will also remind you about them and will help you to schedule them.
